# FCN-CRNN-Segmentation
This is impelmentation of " Recurrent endoder-decoder networks for dense prediction ", which combine FCN (U-net, DeepEM-net) with CRNN(convolution LSTM and GRU, deconvolution one) for EM image segmentation.


# Required library
Keras, Theano

# Code
Run train_predict.py for training or prediction. To predict/train specific model change mode name accordingly.
